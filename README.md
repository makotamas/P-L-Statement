# P&L Statement 

A comprehensive Profit and Lost statement case study about the given data. I analyzed a fictious company. The main goals of the case study are:
- Practising some of the most important functions like: **SUMIF**, **VLOOKUP** etc.
- Building a professional P&L statement
- Setting up a "Database"
- Using various charts to present the results in a understandable way
